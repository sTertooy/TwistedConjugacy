  [33X[0;0YLet  [23XG,  H[123X be groups and [23X\varphi,\psi: H \to G[123X group homomorphisms. Then the
  pair [23X(\varphi,\psi)[123X induces a (right) group action on [23XG[123X given by[133X
  
  
  [24X[33X[0;6YG \times H \to G: (g,h) \mapsto g \cdot h = \psi(h)^{-1} g\varphi(h).[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  group action is called [13X[23X(\varphi,\psi)[123X-twisted conjugation[113X, and induces
  an equivalence relation [23X\sim_{\varphi,\psi}[123X on [23XG[123X:[133X
  
  
  [24X[33X[0;6Yg_1 \sim_{\varphi,\psi} g_2 \iff \exists h \in H: g_1 \cdot h = g2.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  equivalence  classes  (i.e.  the  orbits  of  the  action)  are  called
  [13XReidemeister  classes[113X  and  the number of Reidemeister classes is called the
  Reidemeister   number   [23XR(\varphi,\psi)[123X  of  the  pair  [23X(\varphi,\psi)[123X.  The
  stabiliser  of  the  identity  [23X1_G[123X  for this action is the coincidence group
  [23X\mathrm{Coin}(\varphi, \psi )[123X, i.e. the subgroup of [23XH[123X given by[133X
  
  
  [24X[33X[0;6Y\mathrm{Coin}(\varphi,\psi) := \{ h \in H \mid \varphi(h) = \psi(h) \}.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  [12XTwistedConjugacy[112X  packageprovides  methods  to  calculate  Reidemeister
  classes,  Reidemeister  numbers  and  coincidence  groups  of pairs of group
  homomorphisms.   These   methods  are  implemented  for  finite  groups  and
  (infinite)  polycyclically  presented  groups.  If [23XH[123X and [23XG[123X are both infinite
  polycyclically  presented  groups,  then many of the methods in this package
  are  only guaranteed to produce a result if either [23XG = H[123X and [23XR(\varphi,\psi)[123X
  is  finite,  or  [23XG[123X  is nilpotent-by-finite. If this is not case, methods may
  either  produce  a  (correct!)  result, or throw an error: "[10XError, no method
  found![110X"[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  methods  in  this  package  are  based  on algorithms and theorems from
  [Fel00], [Rom16], [DT21], [Ter21a] and [Ter21b].[133X
