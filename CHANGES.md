This file describes changes in the GAP package 'TwistedConjugacy'.

1.1.0 (04/08/2020)
------------------

- Improved calculation of Reidemeister number for (finite) abelian groups
- CoincidenceGroup now works for homomorphisms with nilpotent range
- IsTwistedConjugate and RepresentativeTwistedConjugation can now always be
  applied to (non-endomorphic) homomorphisms. A result is guaranteed if the
  range is nilpotent-by-finite
- InducedEndomorphism and RestrictedEndomorphism replaced by
  InducedHomomorphism and RestrictedHomomorphism respectively


1.0.1 (07/06/2020)
------------------

- Improvements to PrintObj for ReidemeisterClasses
- Test Suite now has full coverage
- Some functions in HelpFunctions.gi now have local scope
- Updated documentation to include examples


1.0.0 (19/02/2020)
------------------

- Initial release
