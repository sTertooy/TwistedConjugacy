- Improved calculation of Reidemeister number for (finite) abelian groups
- Added AClib package as a suggested package, and provided the following new
  methods if it is loaded:

	  groups
- IsTwistedConjugate and RepresentativeTwistedConjugation now work for
  endomorphisms of nilpotent groups with infinite Reidemeister number
